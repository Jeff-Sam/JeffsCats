		<h1> Sierra's Story </h1>
		<p1> This is Sierra. </p1>

		<br> </br> <p> Sierra was born in 2004 in Delray Beach, Florida. After one of the many hurricanes which had hit the area during the 2004-2005 surge of hurricanes, she was found in a fish house by my father. My father at the time was working for the Florida department of Fish and Game, going around and making sure that people were complying with the laws regarding fish and other activities on the water. Sierra was found in a fishing house, critically malnourished and only a kitten. She was being fed shrimp by the people that worked there, and it was claimed that they intended to use her as shark bait. He took her home and she began her life with us. My dad named her Sierra because he was missing his home state of California and the mountains, and as time would prove, we would move back to California soon after. I terrorized her as a child, which is probably a contributing factor in her skiddishness. Despite this, she's also very quirky. We call her a "domestic feral cat" because she loves to go outside and mess around. She's also a very smart cat, she wakes my parents up by knocking things off their bathroom counter at roughly the same time every morning in an effort to be fed and she also figured out how to open the blinds, and taught our other cats how to do this as well. She also likes to mantain a grooming standard and without fail, will always clean herself after someone so much as pets her. </p>
