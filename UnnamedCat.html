		<h1> The Cat That Cannot Be Named </h1>
			<p1> This is our cat that we cannot hold one name to. </p1>

			<p> <br> </br> This is the other cat we got alongside Mochi not too long ago. From the second my father saw her, he knew she was the one he wanted to take home. According to him, the way she looked at him through the glass was just like the way the cat we had just lost would look at him. When we entered the room, she was very inviting, and greeted everyone she met with a licking. One of the first things I noticed is that he tounge's barbs were especially sharp, but that didn't matter. We ended up leaving with her and Mochi alike.
				<br> </br> Once we brought her home we wanted to change her name. Originally her name was Catalina, but we wanted something more creative. For a while she was unnamed. Then my parents decided on "Slinky". I liked the name but it didn't stick around for long. They later decided that she should be named Wasabi. Why? I don't know, but I feel that "Slinky" represents her personality a little more.
				<br> </br> Speaking about her personality, she definitely has a profound one. She is incredibly hyper and bounces around like a gazelle when she gets spooks. If you accidentally walk up to her and she isn't expecting it, she'll hop off her hind legs into a sort of arch and then run away. It's really funny to watch. Aside from energy level, shes a groomer. She will sit next to you and continue to lick you until you are absolutely spotless. She really enjoys licking human hair as well, it's really weird. She'll lick your eyebrows and even stand on your shoulder and just lick your hair for an hour straight. Let me tell you, it's an unusual feeling. She also loves to groom Mochi, who has become like her play buddy. Sometimes you can catch Mochi returning the favor while she's still licking him. It's like a really weird, awkward, cat makeout-sesh. </p>
