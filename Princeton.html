		<p> <br> </br> Princeton is our Mancoon cat. We got him a few years back from our local no-kill shelter called ARF, short for Animal Rescue Foundation. At the time we were looking to add to our family as we had recently lost a kitten that we only had for a short amount of time. My mom's cousin was out from Florida, where he works saving animals and previously held the title as "Cat Behavioralist". We found a very nice older cat that was very friendly, but was up for re-adoption as his previous family had moved and had to get rid of him. Unfortunatly for that cat, the cousin deemed him as a "person-cat", like a person-person, but a cat. He was very sociable and friendly, but wasn't supposed to get along well with other cats, which wouldn't work in our already three cat household. Then, we found Princeton. He was also a very sociable cat, but he was supposed to get along with other cats just fine. We adopted him and he instantly became my cat. He would hang around me all the time and follow me, and we even called him "my dog" as a joke. He has since become very acclimated to going outdoors, and likes to spend substantial amounts of time outside, only stopping by for food and to say hello. When we got the Unnamed Cat and Mochi, Princeton became sort of isolated as Mochi had claimed my room when Princeton was outside. He was spending more time outside than before and we rarely saw him for the first three weeks of having our newer additions. After about three weeks, he had an accident where I found him after coming home from school with a nasty gash that was bleeding on his head. I brought him inside and once my parents got home we took him to the animal hospital. Everything got sorted and he has since been an indoor cat, and we have been slowly letting him go outside again. <br> </br>
		He's a funny cat. He really likes people and isn't too friendly with other cats, mainly the newer ones because they torment him so much, so he minds his own business. He also is a big complainer, and when he wants to go outside, he makes sure he's heard. He can be heard crying across the house trying to be let outside. He hasn't really been doing this so much since we brought him back indoors, I guess the outdoors is like a drug for some cats. He's also often called a giant fluffball by guests because his Mancoon coat is really long and soft. He's one of the most normal cats we have aside from Sierra, the other two are just crazy. </p>
