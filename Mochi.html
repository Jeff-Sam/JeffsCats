			<p2> <br> </br> Mochi is one of our two newest additions to the family. Mochi is a Bengal-mix (I believe Bengal/American Shorthair), hence the interesting pattern he has. We recently adopted Mochi just a few months ago (date of writing this being 11/28/2017) from an SPCA adoption center. We had recently lost a cat that my dad loved, so he wanted to get a new one to fill the void the last one left. Our intent was to only adopt one cat, but he ended up being the second cat we would take home that day. Mochi was found after an hour of looking around at the cats up for adoption. I was particularly fond of him mainly because of his breed, as I had been wanting to get a Bengal for some time, which I didn't think possible as the cheapest Bengal kittens start upwards of $1,000 USD, and besides, we were only going to adopt a cat if it was in a shelter and needed a home. Once I got into the room where he was staying, he seemed to take little notice of me as he sat in his bed and rarely moved, I also noticed just how big of a cat he was. He's not fat, but he's not lean either, he's just very large. I felt bad for him because his neighbor was a very nasty female cat and he hadn't really been doing anything to aggrevate her, so maybe it was our presence, but she was not having any of it. He seemed like one of those lazy cats that just sit around all day, accumulating mass as they eat, but I was wrong. As I've found out, he was just very shy, and thinking back, his behavior was really odd. Bengal cats are notorius for their high energy behavior, and he was acting as the polar opposite of that, I had assumed it was the American Shorthair in him, but I was wrong. Now, he's a super energetic cat, and is always running around the house, getting under our feet, and jumping onto things he shouldn't. He also has a knack for going onto surfaces without a care in the world, knocking things out of his way, both with his body, and intentionally swinging his paw at things just to watch them hit the ground for fun. This is super annoying and it feels like watching over a little chld or kitten all the time, except he's a two year old cat! He has a wide head and huge bug eyes which makes for some funny faces when he looks at you though. Because I chose him, I guess he's become my cat, and so I have to deal with him knocking over my trash can and jumping on my knightstand multiple times almost every morning. But it's a responsibility I'm willing to have. </p2>
